******GRAPHICS******
-Add graphics to tiles?(pixel art)
-Add animations to all tiles(probably not, would cause lag)
-images for achievements?(simple, small)
square shaped? maybe circle? or rounded square(mixture)
-image of gameplay on title screen(maybe made with pixel art? Might be difficult, would look awesome)
-images of different good/bad events? Probably not

******SOUNDS******
-Add sounds for the buttons presses on menu
-Add achievement sounds
-Add general bad event/good event sound(s)
maybe specific ones? (etc. burning sound effect for FIRE! event) might not work for things like OH NO(virus) event
-Different sounds for different buttons(End Year button might have a different sound than Market button)
-IMPLEMENT finished menu_song song to menu screen

******GAMEPLAY******
-instead of having pull-up menus for buildings have one button that toggles between all modes, have multiple buttons that open a menu that has all of the buildings of that type, makes looking for buildings easier(also once done, maybe make an indicator that there is a building in that menu that can be built(little red tag))
-more achievements
-secret achievements?
-improve mountain generation?
-might be cool to have more buildings that have unique shapes so that using land efficiently is harder
-rotatable buildings? Might be hard to code (already tried, didn't work so well)
-bad event: disaster!(lose insula, -20% population, +10 resources[wreckage])
-building: aqueduct(costs tons of resources(100-150), but acts as a river tile and allows you to place large farms around it (6x1 size?) doesn't need to be placed next to a river
INTELLIGENCE:
-instead of resources to get blueprints from market, have a tech screen that allows you to advance your technology and upgrade temples, mines and other buildings
-gain intelligence by trading(only normal market gives you very small amounts of intelligence), but trading due to events gives you a lot of intelligence
-could have events based in intelligence:
  -philosopher asks for resources in return for intelligence
  -if you fail a trade you loose intelligence points, in the market or event trades
-MAIN SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCE:
-building: workshop(costs little resources(10-20) but needs a lot of people operating it(5-10))
-small, medium, and large versions of workshop
-produces intelligence each year depending on size
******LORE/REALISM******
RARE bad event: plague!(aqueduct is made of lead, causes lead poisoning, loose some population, but never can happen again, although from then on, using aqueducts causes people to have a higher chance to revolt
-another post-endgame option: let the world burn- lets you keep playing, but gives you infinite power
-probably base city developing off of rome, many interesting events and disasters can occur
-change "temples" to churches? Maybe have a seperate building called church, and could have conflict events between the two religions, but churches don't give you extra luck
-maybe instead of building the mega temple to win, you have to build all major landmarks of rome to win?
